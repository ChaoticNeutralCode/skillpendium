Characters with the roping skill can expertly throw a rope to snare/lasso a cow&apos;s horns, a horses neck, or the hoofs of either, to enable a 140 pound man to capture and subdue a half ton animal! Hitched around the saddle horn, a lariat can be used to pull a mired animal out of a bog, mud or river, as well as keep a hobbled horse or other animal from straying away in the night or rain, and the rope can even be used to create an instant, make -shift corral, when stretched taut by several men, to contain and hold a herd of animals - and even for quick justice at the end of a hangman&apos;s noose.<p></p> &#xA0;&#xA0;The roping skill includes knowledge and training in how to use a lariat, lasso, tie knots, expertly handle roped animals after they are snared, bring them to a stop by taking quick turns of the lariat around the saddle horn (known as &quot;dally&quot; or &quot;da la vuelta&quot;), tethering animals, and how to &quot;hog-tie&quot; animals (after the animal has been lassoed, the horse backs up to make the rope taut while the cowboy &quot;tips&quot; over the animal and ties three legs with a half shank; used in separating stubborn animals from the herd, capturing wild animals, and branding). The rope/lariat can be used for the roping and tying of animals, including cattle, horses, similar alien animals, and even small dinosaurs and people. This skill with a lariat can be executed standing on the ground, but is designed and intended to be done from horseback (or hovercycle).<p></p> &#xA0;&#xA0;A failed roll to tie a knot means that it is loose, sloppy and easy to untie, slip out of, or likely to unravel or snap when strained. A failed roll to lasso an animal or stationary target, means it misses its mark or slips off.<p></p> &#xA0;&#xA0;Against human and intelligent opponents, roll to lasso as if it were a combat attack to strike and ensnare. The intended victim can try to dodge; parry is not applicable. A successful strike means the character is caught in the lasso. Ensnaring a foot, leg or hand means the victim can be tripped, knocked down and pulled/dragged by hand or horse. Ensnaring the upper body means one arm is pinned (useless). Two or more lassoes around the upper body means both arms are pinned and attacks requiring the use of one&apos;s hands are impossible, and the lassoed individual can be pulled off his feet and dragged. Multiple lassoes can also be used to snare each limb and &quot;spread-eagle&quot; the character. It takes 1D4 melee actions to cut through a lasso, but it is impossible to draw a weapons and cut oneself loose if both arms are pinned or while being dragged. In this combat usage, the roping character is +1 to strike for every 20 points of skill, so a skill of 65% means a +3 to strike/ensnare.  </body></html>","bases":[20],"perLevel":5},{"name":"Trick Riding","categories":[3],"tag":"trickriding","description":"<html><head></head><body>Riding bareback, standing on the animal&apos;s back, hanging from the side, or under its belly (usually for rodeo tricks or to hide from enemies), side saddle, as well as quick mounts and dismounts, mounting a horse by leaping down from above or with a running start, leaping from the back of a horse onto another horse or wagon, and similar. <b>Skill Requirement:</b> Must know one of the horsemanship skills, or trick riding cannot be selected.

While traps may not damage M.D. equipment, unless the trap is augmented with explosives (requiring the Demolitions skill), simple pits can hamper, even immobilize, troops and robot vehicles by making them unable to climb out (will earth walls support the weight of a several ton robot trying to climb out?

Sleight of hand also includes a basic level of escape artistry.

Within the Biosphere; the basic unit of study is the ecosystem - a community of plants and animals in an environment supplying the raw materials for life, i.e., chemical elements (or food) and water. An ecosystem is delimited by climate, altitude, latitude, water and soil characteristics, and other physical conditions. The energy for fueling life activities reaches the earth in the form of sunlight. By photosynthesis green plants capture that light energy and store it in the chemical bonds of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Some of the energy is acquired by plant-eating animals, and a fraction of it passed on to predatory animals. Such sequences, called food chains, overlap at many points, forming food webs. Once spent, the energy for life cannot be replenished except by further exposure of green plants to sunlight. The chemicals of life are continually recycled by such processes as photosynthesis, reception, and nitrogen fixation. Disruption of these cycles by natural causes such as drought or pollution can disturb the balance of an entire ecosystem. An ecosystem that has reached a stable and self-perpetuating stage is known as a climax community. When extensive and well-defined, the climax community is called biome. Examples are tundra, savanna (grassland), desert, and forests.
